        This specification defines a mechanism for Web applications to register themselves as
        being able to handle certain specific types of services ("grant wishes") with a user
        agent. Once a service handler is registered, any Web application can then request its
        functionality from the user agent in order to compose the service into itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a Web application could register itself as an image editor. When another
        application needs image editing functionality (e.g. a meme generator) then it can 
        instantiate the image editor as part of itself (typically in an <code>iframe</code>). The
        editor is selected based on user preference rather than by hardcoding it. This provides a
        simple yet powerful component model for Web applications.
