        This specification defines a mechanism for Web applications to register themselves as
        being able to handle certain specific types of services ("grant wishes") with a user
        agent. Once a service handler is registered, any Web application can then request its
        functionality from the user agent in order to compose the service into itself.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines a mechanism for Web applications to register themselves as
        being able to handle certain specific types of services ("grant wishes") with a user
        agent. Once a service handler is registered, any Web application can then request its
        functionality from the user agent in order to compose the service into itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a Web application could register itself as an image editor. When another
        application needs image editing functionality (e.g. a meme generator) then it can 
        instantiate the image editor as part of itself (typically in an <code>iframe</code>). The
        editor is selected based on user preference rather than by hardcoding it. This provides a
        simple yet powerful component model for Web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This functionality is similar to that provided in Android Intents or in FirefoxOS   
        Activities. However, in order to ship more quickly and to explore the simpler options first
        this specification is limited to a subset of the functionality afforded in existing systems.

      <h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        This section details a variety of usage scenarios for Wishes in order to help define how
        exactly they should work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that all code examples are provisional and use completely made up syntax. The scenarios
        rely on the following loose terminology (to be tightened up when the view is clearer).
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>application</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A regular Web application running in the user's browser, and typically calling upon wishes
          in the following scenarios.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>wish service</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          A Web page written in such a way that it knows how to fulfil a wish and that exposes
          functionality to the application in that way.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <section>
        <h2>Fire &amp; Forget</h2>
        <p>
          This is the simplest case. Here the <a>application</a> formulates a wish but does not care
          about any return value, or even about the success, of the wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical example is the wish to share. The user is visiting an application page,
          finds it most cromulous, and wishes to share it with the world at large.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/share-click.jpg' width="800" height="497">
          <figcaption>
            User clicks the “share” button in order to share this most cromulous piece of humour.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The user is then presented with a list of wish services that she has installed in her user
          agent (or, possibly, more generally on her operating system). Of these she selects the
          “Unicorner” social sharing site where she can share with her fellow unicorns.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src='img/scenarios/share-picker.jpg' width="800" height="497">
          <figcaption>
            User selects “Unicorner” in the list of services that can fulfil the wish to share.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The “Unicorner” web site, which is a social sharing web site that the user happens to like
          (here showing how Wishes can help open up the Web to new contenders without having to 
          battle the inertia of millions of authors having to add new buttons to their pages), opens
          up atop the <a>application</a> being shared (with some sort of signal that the <a>wish
          service</a> is related to the <a>application</a> — all of this is naturally 
          implementation-dependent). The user can interact with it and hit “Share”.
        </p>
